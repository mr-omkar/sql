# üìä Esports Tournament Data Analysis
This project is about SQL to perform exploratory data analysis. The data set is a dummy data set with some minimal data.
This project is basically done to gain some better knowledge and have a more tighter grip upon SQL. 
For this I have used SQLite.



## üóÇ Creating Database
Created a database of a Tournament with and inserted some dummy data to do some analysis upon the data. The database, named zomato_data contains 4 tables: Teams, Matches and Players.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ creating table Teams:
        CREATE TABLE Teams (
        team_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        team_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        country VARCHAR(50),
        captain_id INT
        );
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ creating table Players:
        CREATE TABLE Players (
        player_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        player_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        team_id INT,
        role VARCHAR(50),
        salary INT,
        FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES Teams(team_id)
        );
## 3Ô∏è‚É£ creating table Matches:
        CREATE TABLE Matches (
          match_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
          team1_id INT,
          team2_id INT,
          match_date DATE,
          winner_id INT,
          score_team1 INT,
          score_team2 INT,
          FOREIGN KEY (team1_id) REFERENCES Teams(team_id),
          FOREIGN KEY (team2_id) REFERENCES Teams(team_id),
          FOREIGN KEY (winner_id) REFERENCES Teams(team_id)
          );
