# üìä Marketing Analysis
The 'Sustainable Clothing Co.' have been running several marketing campaigns and have asked to provide your insight into whether they have been successful or not. 
This project is about SQL to perform exploratory data analysis. The data set is a dummy data set much like Marketing and with some minimal data.
This project is basically done to gain some better knowledge and have a more tighter grip upon SQL. For this I have used Microsoft SQL server

## üóÇ Creating Database
Created a database with and inserted some dummy data to do some analysis upon the data. The database, named clothing_data contains 4 tables: sustainable_clothing, marketing_campaign and transcations


## 1Ô∏è‚É£ creating table sustainable_clothing:
        CREATE TABLE sustainable_clothing (
          product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
          product_name VARCHAR(100),
          category VARCHAR(50),
          size VARCHAR(10),
          price FLOAT
          );
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ creating table marketing_campaigns:
        CREATE TABLE marketing_campaigns (
          campaign_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
          campaign_name VARCHAR(100),
          product_id INT,
          start_date DATE,
          end_date DATE,
          FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES sustainable_clothing (product_id)
          );
## 3Ô∏è‚É£ creating table transactions:
        CREATE TABLE transactions (
          transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
          product_id INT,
          quantity INT,
          purchase_date DATE,
          FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES sustainable_clothing (product_id)
          );
          
## üìà Some Analysis That Are Performed
From next are some important questions based on which analysis is performed. Some these questions are really important in improving upon any particular product, the business model.


## 1)How many transactions were completed during each marketing campaign?
